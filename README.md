# hello-world
Hey Everyone, 

This is a new project for me as I am new to coding. 

I am doing the 100 Days of Code challenge and have decided to document my progress here, and learn github in the process. 

So, essentially this is my hello-world project! 

Since I work in Security, I think that I may explore some python to start. 

All the best,
