# hello-world
Hey Everyone, 

This is a new project for me as I am new to coding. 

I am doing the 100 Days of Code challenge. I have decided to document my progress here, and learn github in the process. 

This is my hello-world project! 

I will be learning python from learnpython.org, and possibly other places as I go along. 
I will update this along the way. 

All the best,
